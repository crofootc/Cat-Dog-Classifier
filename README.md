# Cat-Dog Identifier

The following is a model I developed to practice image recognition. I coded the whole project from start to finish. I built my training data set from 10,000+ images of cats and dogs by writing a webscraper to download images from various subreddits. I then used my dataset to develop a model to classify if a given picture is of a cat or of a dog.
